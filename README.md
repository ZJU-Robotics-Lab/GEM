## GEM: Online Globally consistent dense elevation mapping for unstructured terrain (lidar-only)

This is a [ROS] package developed for elevation mapping with a mobile robot which is modified on [ANYbotics](https://www.anybotics.com/) Elevation Map method. This package further implements a GPU version of the point cloud process and a global mapping module. 

The software is designed for (local-global) navigation tasks with robots that are equipped with pose estimation (e.g. IMU & odometry) and a distance sensor (e.g. structured light (Kinect, RealSense), laser range sensor, stereo camera). The provided local elevation map is limited around the robot and reflects the pose uncertainty that is aggregated through the motion of the robot (robot-centric mapping). The global map is represented as several submaps corresponding to a pose provided by odometry. This method is developed to explicitly handle drift of the robot pose estimation.

The online Globally consistent dense Elevation Mapping (GEM) packages have been tested under ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 16.04. This is research code, expect that it changes often and any fitness for a particular purpose is disclaimed.

## Installation

### Dependencies

This software is built on the Robotic Operating System ([ROS]), which needs to be [installed](http://wiki.ros.org) first. Additionally, the Globally consistent dense Elevation Mapping depends on following software:

- [Grid Map](https://github.com/anybotics/grid_map) (grid map library for mobile robots)
- [kindr](http://github.com/anybotics/kindr) (kinematics and dynamics library for robotics),
- [kindr_ros](https://github.com/anybotics/kindr_ros) (ROS wrapper for kindr),
- [Point Cloud Library (PCL)](http://pointclouds.org/) (point cloud processing),
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (linear algebra library, tested on 3.2.9 & 3.3.4; failed on 3.3.9).
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) (gpu process)
- [slam_msg](https://github.com/ZJU-Robotics-Lab/slam_msg) (msg need for detected loops)
- cudnn (pay attention to the version: CUDA 10.0 -> cudnn 7.4; CUDA 10.1 -> cudnn 7.6)

### Building

In order to install the GEM, clone the latest version from this repository into your catkin workspace and compile the package using ROS.

    cd catkin_workspace/src
    git clone https://github.com/ZJU-Robotics-Lab/GEM.git
    git clone https://github.com/ZJU-Robotics-Lab/slam_msg.git
    git clone https://github.com/ANYbotics/kindr_ros.git
    cd ../
    catkin_make


## Basic Usage

In order to get the GEM to run with your robot, you will need to adapt a few parameters. It is the easiest if duplicate and adapt all the parameter files that you need to change from the `elevation_mapping_demos` package (e.g. the `simple_demo` example). These are specifically the parameter files in `config` and the launch file from the `launch` folder.

    roslaunch elevation_mapping_demos simple_demo.launch

## Simple Demo

You can get our demo bag from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hv3ovZnAVSpL0T6GZkJQ14Ptm4w_1ALc/view?usp=sharing

    rosbag play test.bag --clock --pause
    roslaunch elevation_mapping_demos simple_demo.launch


## Nodes

    The size of the robot pose cache.

* **`robot_local_map_size`** (int, default: 20)

    The local map size.

* **`min_update_rate`** (double, default: 2.0)

* **`fused_map_publishing_rate`** (double, default: 1.0)

    The rate for publishing the entire (fused) elevation map.

Depending on how dense or sparse your scans are, increase or reduce the scanning duration. Smaller values lead to faster dynamic object removal and bigger values help to reduce faulty map cleanups.
